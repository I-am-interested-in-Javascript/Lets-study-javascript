1. Foundations of Javascript
- global에서 함수가 실행되면, we create a global execution context

- thread of execution(parsing and executing the code line after line)

- live memory of variables with data(known as a global variable environment)

=> these two are execution context(in this case global execution context) \ 
=> thread is singular(no two stuff running at once) \
=> use stack to keep track of where an exeution context is created
top of call stack is where I am right now

2. Asynchronous Javascript

3. Iterators

4. Generators & Async/await
