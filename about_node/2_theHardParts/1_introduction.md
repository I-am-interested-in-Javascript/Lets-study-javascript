1. Each programming language(PHP, Ruby, C++, Javascript) have different levels of ability to interact with these features directly

C++ has many features that let it directly interact with the OS directly

Javascript does not. So it has to work with C++ to control these computer features. What is this combination known as? ... Node js

JS -> Node -> Computer feature (e.g. network, file system)


2. Lets see the 2 things that JS does by itself - svaing and using data

let num = 3;

1. Save a function(code to run, parameters awaiting inputs)
function multifplyBy2(){}

2. Call/run/invoke/execute a function


Save code -> run it later

Thread of execution: Javascripts' power to execute as it goes



3. So let's see Javascript other talent - built-in labels that trigger node featrues
We can set up, with a javascript label, a node js feature(and so computer internals) to wait for requests for html/css/js/twets from our users

How? the most powerful built-in node feature of all: Http!(and its associated built-in label in JS - also Http)
