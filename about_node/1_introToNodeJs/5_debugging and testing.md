## debugging and testing
- level1
  - use console.log to log your way through fixing your app. in production, record your logs

- level2
  - use the node inspector when starting your app and debug just like you would and browser app in chrome
  - node --inspect exercises/api/server.js 이렇게 inspect사용가능하다. 
    chrome://inspect/#devices

- level3
  - text editor integration offers the most seamless experience


## testing
before you can test your code, make sure it is testable. as long as you can export what you want to test, you should be able to test it. There are othere concerns specific to what libraries and frameworks you use

you can test pretty much anything in nodejs. browser apps, API's, CLI's, scripts, tools, etc. your test themselves will be executed in nodejs, so they have the ability to pretty much do anything.

## 마무리 하며..
다시 돌아올겁니다..
그런데 node js로 앱을 한번 만들어보고 다시 강의의 내용을 들어보려고 한다. 여튼 이렇게 재밌는게 있다니, 한 일년정도는 자바스크립트로 이것저것 다 해보려고 한다.
